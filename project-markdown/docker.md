# Docker

Docker is a technology for containerization mostly used for software
development. It is an open source tool which makes it easy to deploy
applications within containers. Applications are packaged in
containers and then they are shipped to the platforms that they need
to be executed upon. Applications distributed as containers are
divided into manageable sizes and all the dependent functions are
added and individually packaged. Operating systems such as macOS,
Linux, Windows 10 Education and Windows 10 Pro are supported
by Docker. However containers do require hardware support that needs
to be available and activated.

### Docker Containers

Docker image creates a docker container. Containers have everything for
the application to run on its own.

## Benefits of using Docker

Using docker has a number of benefits

* *Open Source Technology*: The Docker containers are based on open
standards which means that anyone can contribute to the Docker tool
and at the same time customize it for their needs, if the features
they are looking for is not already available.

* *Portability*: Docker makes distributed applications to be dynamic
and portable which can be run anywhere which makes it extremely
popular among developers.

* *Sharing*: Docker is integrated with a software sharing and
distribution mechanism that allows for sharing and using container
content which helps the tasks of both the developer and the operations
team.

* *Elimination of Environmental Inconsistencies*: Any changes made in
one environment will be shared across other environments or all the
applications can exist in the single environment.

* *Resource Isolation*: Resource isolation adds to the security of
running containers on a given host. Docker uses Namespaces technology
to isolate work spaces called containers. Namespace is created when
container is run and access is limited to that namespace only. Every
container in Docker will have its own work space which makes it easier
debug if there are issues with any particular container.

* *Easy Integration*: Docker can be easily integrated into a variety
of infrastructure tools like Amazon Web Services, Ansible, IBM
Bluemix, Jenkins, Google Cloud Platform, Oracle Container Cloud
Service, Microsoft Azure to name a few.

* *Better Security*: Docker provides a interface for developers and IT
teams to define and manage their security configurations for
applications as it navigates from one stage to another.

### Docker - Use Cases

The Docker platform is the only container platform to build, secure and
manage the variety of applications from development to production both
on premises and in the cloud. It also creates room for innovation,
increases time to market, highly agile. Docker supports diverse set of
applications and infrastructure for both developers and IT. It
transforms IT without having to re-tool, re-code or re-vamp existing
applications, policies or staffÂ [@hackernoon].
