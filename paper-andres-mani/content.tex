\section{Introduction}

In the current fast-paced society,  production of goods continues to 
increase, and new distribution chains continuously change. The generation 
of waste and the deprecated goods -from now on referred to as solid waste- 
has increased over the past ten years, rising from approximately 0.64 kg 
per person per day of solid waste to approximately 1.2 kg per person per day. 
Projections estimate that this number is expected to increase to about 
1.42 kg by 2025~\cite{hoornweg2012}. This continual change and increase make 
waste management a more complex and more intensive endeavor.  

While the quantity of waste itself can and should be reduced by conscious use 
and discipline in recycling and reusing items, local governments and waste 
management companies can also make modifications to their systems to reduce 
waste in the actual collection and disposal.

Because of this, different local governments and organizations have recognized 
the need to develop more elaborate regulations to control the different 
features, segments, processes involved in waste disposal from the moment the 
material is discarded by the consumer to the moment the material reaches its 
ultimate destination, such as a recycling plant or landfill. This set of 
systematic regulations is called solid waste management. Solid waste 
management has changed over time.  What used to be systems designed and 
implemented based on local needs and convenient disposal as moved into 
extensively researched and implemented management systems that consider 
complex multivariable and dynamic sources of data~\cite{akbarpour2016}.

Currently, data used in waste management is collected from many sources and 
varies depending on the types of solid waste and the rate of disposal of a 
particular population. Because of the diversity of data available
 (including types of waste, weight collected, the location of collection and 
disposal), the quality of the data must be continually monitored and 
assessed~\cite{chandrappa2012}. New management systems that seek to optimize 
waste management must collect large volumes of data from various data sources 
on a daily basis in order to compile information essential for optimization.  
Multivariate data analysis methods provide exploratory data analysis, 
classification and parameter prediction using this data~\cite{bohm2013}. 

\section{ Municipal Solid Waste Management}
%a) the complexities of waste management optimization 

There are various factors that contribute to the complexity of optimizing 
waste management systems and the types of data needed for analysis to do so.  
These include differences in composition of waste, environmental and 
logistic needs for individual communities, the changing forms of handling 
various materials such as recyclables, and the various ways that waste 
can be disposed of.  

There are significant differences between the general composition of the 
waste generated in rural areas and the waste produced in urban areas. The 
waste produced in the later is profoundly influenced by the culture and 
the practices of our modern society.  This distinction means that there 
will inevitably need to be differentiation in waste management practices 
and systems based on each communities needs, commerce, economy, and 
practices~\cite{chandrappa2012}.

Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), commonly known as garbage or trash, consists 
of items that residential, commercial, institutional and industrial sites 
generate. This is much different from the type of waste produced, for 
example, in an agricultural community.  Urban, or municipal, waste can be 
the result of everyday activities, such as leftover food, plastic bottles, 
packaging material, wooden furniture, electrical and electronic appliances, 
glass, medical waste, card boards, waste tires, office wastes, consumer goods, 
among others.  Each type of waste needs to be handled in distinct manners.  

The amounts of solid waste and its composition vary depending on the country, 
place, and activity performed at the site where the waste is 
generated~\cite{chandrappa2012}. For this reason, every process related to 
waste management (transportation, storing and final disposition, among others) 
must be engineered and tailored to fit the specific needs of community, 
organization, or local institution. The data collected for analysis will 
also be specific to the needs and realities of each entity, which is why 
waste management plans are not universal or easily applied from one 
community to another.  

The forms of handling waste have also changed over the years, affecting the 
best ways to manage waste.  One example of this is the increasing ability 
to separate and recycle various materials. Data on the recyclable material, 
dividing waste and recyclable material, how materials are sent or how they 
are disposed of has become significant. According to EPA statistics from 
2014, Americans generated about 258 million tons of MSW of which more than 
89 million tons is recycled and composted. This is an equivalent to a 34.6\% 
recycling rate compared to 6.4\% in 1960. With the increase in recycling 
capabilities and consciousness, adaptations must be made to the management 
systems~\cite{epa2014}.  

Another variable that is how waste is disposed of.  Americans have used the 
energy production process to combust approximately 33 million tons of waste,  
while as much as 136 million tons of waste ended up in landfills during the 
same year~\cite{epa2014}. Local governments must determine which form of 
waste disposal is more efficient and cost-effective based on their unique 
context. They must take into consideration access to and distance from 
disposal facilities, types of waste being disposed of, and specific 
environmental implications of each process based on their geographic, 
geological, and environmental context.  

In waste management, decision-makers are and will continue to be forced to 
make choices.  When they develop or implement plans, they have a choice as 
to what information they will or will not consider for analysis.  They have 
to choose what factors are influential in their jurisdiction.  They make 
choices about routes, resources, and all the details between pick up to 
disposal. These choices can be classified as fortuitous, good, or 
optimal~\cite{akbarpour2016}.

Fortuitous decision-making has no scientific base; the person who is in 
charge of making decisions must always try to solve the problem with 
little or no research or data.   On the other hand, good decision-making 
is primarily based on experience, comparison of elements and trial and error. 
 Optimal decision making, however, requires understanding and analysis of 
 techniques and technologies provided by other fields~\cite{akbarpour2016}. 

This is where Big Data comes in. 

\section{ Big data and waste management}
%b) why is big data involved

Big data has the capacity to facilitate analysis of information so that 
better decisions can be made.

In Big Data, the expert in charge takes many data sets coming from diverse 
and dynamic data sources and applies technologies to analyse these data sets.  
Authors of papers and books like ``The Fourth Paradigm'' state that big data 
exploration works to find patterns in data by analysing the trends and 
outliers found in the data sets mentioned above, to generate 
knowledge~\cite{hey2009fourth}.

Characteristics (such as the large volume of data generated in waste 
management, how dynamically the data is generated, and the variety of 
formats in which the data comes) make the task of producing knowledge an 
ideal task for Big Data.  Scientists can interpret the findings of Big Data  
in a way that allows individuals and institutions involved in waste management 
to make optimal decisions~\cite{yenkar2014review}. 

\section{Solutions for effective Waste Management}
%how can big data or analytic of big data help

\subsection{ Examples of Big data and waste management}

Various institutions around the world have explored and implemented Big Data 
analytic to optimize their waste management systems based on their unique 
needs.

In Manchester, England, the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority, 
England's most significant waste management institution, has started to 
use Big Data to better orchestrate the waste management services they 
provide. To get the most out of their Big Data approach, the Greater 
Manchester Waste Disposal Authority is working in collaboration with the 
research done by the University of Manchester. Together, they are trying 
to create environmentally sustainable solutions for Manchester, and are 
attempting to develop optimal solutions to the 1.1 million tons of waste 
that Manchester produces every year.   While their work has not been 
implemented yet, they have recognized the need for both research and 
partnership with research institutions to compile and analyse 
data~\cite{markvan2016}.

Another example of a local government implementing Big Data Solutions is 
the city of  Songdo, South Korea. In said city, every citizen needs to use 
a chip card while disposing of their garbage. Data collected from these 
chip cards is being used to analysing on the quantity of disposed waste and 
their locations. Each trash bin is incorporated with sensors to provide the 
height of the garbage accumulated in the reciprocal, temperature, and air 
pollution levels. These multiple parameters help municipal authorities 
forecast ideal times to collect the trash and optimize the routes to save 
time and expenses~\cite{markvan2016}.

Researchers in Ethiopia are combining socioeconomic data alongside geographic 
data in order to get a clearer understanding of the patterns of how household 
waste is being collected and distributed. This study helped local authorities 
to better manage waste practices in urban areas~\cite{markvan2016}. 

A group of researchers from the University of Stockholm is using Big Data to 
identify how to optimize waste management routes in their city. By using a 
wide variety of data sets collected from various sources, roughly around half 
a million entries including trash bin locations, weights, and truck routes, 
researchers have developed waste generation maps of Stockholm. This research 
has helped reveal various inefficiencies in the current waste management 
system and will be integral in helping them improve their local waste 
management~\cite{markvan2016}.

\subsubsection{Vehicle Routing Problem}
Vehicle route optimization is one of the primary concerns in waste management. 
It is termed as Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)~\cite{dantzig1959}.  
While routes may be designed based on geography, merely looking at a map and 
designing what seems to be functional movement through the city, this is 
underestimating the extent of the factors involved.  There are multiple 
factors that either directly or indirectly affect waste collection that can 
also be analyzed and considered while designing routes. Common known factors 
that influence vehicle routing are the type of vehicle, vehicle capacity, 
number of collection stops, volume per capita and the route length. 

Two of the most fundamental VRPs are the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) 
and the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP)~\cite{belien2012}. However, when too 
many constraints and attributes are considered, both of the TSP and CPP become 
more difficult problems to solve. Many researchers have studied and published 
articles on waste management vehicle routing problem VRPs, and yet it is a 
persistent problem. Mathematical models need to be developed to provide city 
administrators with tools to make effective long-and short-term decisions 
relating to their municipal disposal system~\cite{bhat1996}. 

In addition to the typical known factors causing VRP problems, indirect 
attributes must also be taken into consideration.  Time of day, traffic, 
weather patterns, energy prices, demand fluctuations, vehicle health, 
dump site inventory also have potential to affect route efficiency. 

A research team at OSI came up with a better solution for solving VRP 
problems using Big Data technologies. Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) 
formulation was designed to interact with millions of attributes in live 
environments providing real-time decisions to optimize the VRP. Big Data 
technologies are being used to enable prediction of travel times and 
forecast and address demand on a tactical time line. This approach has 
helped improve VRP forecasting between  5\% to 10\%~\cite{vijay2013}. 
Any improvement, even less than 5\% created on VRP is a significant 
improvement~\cite{hasle2007}.

Scientists and engineers have designed a system to collect data that 
communicates between waste reciprocals, waste collection vehicles and a 
central system using sensors that measure how full containers are and can 
send real-time data~\cite{faccio2011}.

The data collected can be used to optimize routes and space in the waste 
collection vehicles.  Sensors can identify which containers do not need 
to be collected, allowing them to shorten routes when containers do not 
have sufficient volume to be collected.  In addition, sensors can measure 
the remaining capacity of collection vehicles, allowing them to extend routes 
when they still have cargo space, ensuring that they return to the disposal 
center only when they are carrying a full load.  After the implementation 
of this system, the city was able minimize inefficient travel and fewer 
collection vehicles were needed.  It was estimated that in three years, 
the expense of purchasing and implementing this system would be 
recovered~\cite{shahrokni2014big}.

In addition to the real-time data collection that helps optimize collection 
and routes, remote self-diagnostics are also helping optimize vehicle use. 
By being able to monitor the vehicles use and health, maintenance and repair 
are more efficiently managed.  Through this system, managers are made aware 
of parts that need to be ordered in advance, limiting the time that the 
vehicles may be out of service.  Hand held devices have been developed for 
service verification, further helping minimize external providers or 
assessments, optimizing asset management and costs~\cite{megan2017}.

\subsubsection{Problem of Landfill Disposal}

A municipal solid waste landfill (MSWLF) is an individually isolated area 
of land or a trench where the household waste is collected and stored. 
These landfills are designed to store municipal solid waste as well as other 
wastes like construction and industrial waste. These landfills can be 
open-pits or below ground refuse chambers. In recent years, it's becoming 
more expensive to operate and maintain these landfills as well as to 
protect the environment liquid pollutants that drain from the waste and 
which can cause water and surface contamination. These liquid pollutants 
are commonly called as leachate. Leachate forms when water originating 
from rainfall or groundwater dissolves gradually through a porous surface 
and dissolves the chemicals from the refuse especially if the protective 
layer of the landfill allows liquid or gases to pass through it. 

Leachate contamination problems have become more problematic in older 
landfill sites where they lacked appropriate barriers above or below the 
landfills.  This contamination has been found to cause pollution which may 
be a cause of  diseases affecting the citizens residing in close proximity 
to these landfills. In modern days, Governments across the world are 
motivated to prevent environmental contamination due to waste disposal and 
to reduce the size and expansion of landfill deposits. Steps are taken to 
reduce the number of landfill areas and to extend landfill capacity at 
current sites. 

Landfill disposal, in itself, has its own set of complex factors including 
measurement and control of gases, management of waste water, and precipitation 
patterns affecting water volume and run off  in the geological basin.  

Identifying these factors creates an opportunity to develop sensors that 
could collect meaningful data that would be an asset to optimizing landfill 
disposal.  Sensors could measure gas emission, water volume in disposed 
waste, and precipitation.  Having this information would allow data 
scientists to develop systems that would identify when disposal would need 
to be varied, how water treatment plants could efficiently manage run-off 
and basin water and how to communicate with water treatment plants to use 
more or less of their mechanical resources based on real-time needs. 

Manual calculation would be time-consuming subject to human error and 
physical observation opens space for inefficiency and delay.  In order 
to compute these calculations promptly so that the information could 
contribute to optimization, it would be ideal to develop a computer program 
to compute the mathematical operations.  These calculations could translated 
into real time information that would help manage the systems in place. 
This would contribute significantly to optimization of water treatment, 
for example, in landfill disposal~\cite{akbarpour2016}.

Waste management is already in the process of transforming from using older 
methodologies to modern Big Data technologies. Big Data has a lot more 
potential to eradicate many of the problems faced by government in waste 
disposal. Most of the government organizations are taking a leap to minimize 
disposal of waste and to achieve ``zero waste'' goals~\cite{rosengren2017}. 

A program in government of District of Columbia called ``Zero Waste DC'' 
has initiated developments in order to provide resources that will help 
its residents move towards zero waste. Its primary motive is to divert 
80\% of MSW to recycling or source of energy where the remaining 20\% 
non recoverable waste will be sent to landfills. By collecting vast amounts 
of data from all sources, they will analyze  the date collected to implement 
cost-effective strategies for converting waste to re-usable resources, 
improving environmental conditions, taking measures on human health, 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving of natural resources. 
By obtaining data from the sensors measuring contamination of air with 
harmful gases, water purification levels from the nearby lakes, physical 
properties as well as chemical properties of the soil, Big Data will be 
able to help analyze this data and provide solutions to prevent further 
pollution and help design better systems in the future~\cite{rosengren2017}.

One of the reasons for Big Data to have such high volumes of information 
in these examples, is that the sensors that collect the data gather it on 
a daily basis and from different sources like digital meters, sensors and 
social media. 

In some cases it is possible to read information from the sensors placed in 
recycle bins, the data they provide allows the company in charge to identify 
the type of waste is being disposed in the trash bins and which resident does 
it. If somebody places hazardous materials in the bins, authorities can detect 
them before  being collected by the waste management vehicles. Besides 
preventing unwanted incidents, this kind of information can be used to 
develop tailored waste management training for the public. Big Data Analysis 
can also be employed in other areas of education, to encourage citizens to 
use food scraps as fertilizer and even develop strategies like 
``farm to farm'' practices where the public institution can promote 
urban organic farming~\cite{james2012}.

On the same line, the use of Big Data technologies employed in the  waste 
disposal process, provides visibility to the amounts and characteristics 
of the organic waste, particularly when it comes to food waste. 
Identifying inefficiencies in food management, can be used to plan and 
improve the food production and transportation chains. These and other 
applications of Big Data, enable food related companies to make effective 
decisions in their purchase and procurement departments, as well as their 
management of their own organic waste~\cite{frank2016}.

United States' Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is using Big Data in 
their waste management and recycle research. Big Data Analysis is used to 
identify quantities of solid waste being recycled and informing the public 
about the benefits they may receive when they recycle. A Municipal Solid 
Waste Characterization Report issued by the EPA in 2007, contains the data 
collected on generation and disposal of waste in the United States within 
the 30 years prior to the release of said report. This data is being 
analysed to measure waste reduction and plan recycling programs across the 
country~\cite{epaRecycleBenefits2007}.

\subsection{Statistics and Waste Management}

The data collected from the different activities related to Municipal Waste 
Management, can be run through mathematical models developed to predict 
behaviour and understand causes to complex issues. In other words, these 
data and applying statistics can be used by Big Data professionals to draw 
conclusions and foresee possible outcomes as related to effective policy 
making and actual waste production, collection, and disposal patterns. 

In the field of statistics and probability, there are many data analysis 
methods that are used to  study waste management and production, but the 
two most popular are: PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and PLS1
 (or Partial Least Squares Regression). The Principal Component Analysis  
reveals relevant parameters within a large parameter set. This allows the 
researcher to find the most significant and essential properties of a sample 
when studying a particular question. On the other hand, scientists use the 
Partial Least Squares Regression to identify in two matrices, the major 
internal and external correlations~\cite{bohm2013}.

There are many applications tools and packages that are well known in 
statistics that can be applied to waste management, some of them are 
SPSS, Canoco, The Unscrambler and R~\cite{bohm2013}.
There is also  a mathematical modeling language developed  particularly 
for formulating and solving  optimization problems using linear programming, 
called Lingo. Lingo optimization software uses the branch and bound methods 
to solve problems similar to the ones found when studying waste 
management~\cite{akbarpour2016}.

These resources are valuable to the continual analysis of data being 
collected, continually helping in waste management optimization.

\subsection{GIS Analytics}

When it comes to Geographical Information Systems (From now on GIS), 
there are multiple software and hardware options in the market. From 
paid software like ArcGIS to Open and free software like GVSIG, some 
solutions can help interpret large data sets, apply statistics and 
algorithms of different kinds and display them in a way that refers 
to a geographical space. 

Two optimal routing algorithms have been used to calculate routes for 
waste collection; Solomon's insertion algorithm and a clustering algorithm.  
Data was used to help create more efficient routes by minimizing driving 
distance while taking into consideration factors like lunch breaks
 (time windows) that affected the distribution of human resources and 
time/vehicle management. By adding vehicle depots, by rerouting, 
and by sharing various routes, they predicted that they would be able 
to shorten vehicle expenditure by as much as 10,000 km.  

An additional routing algorithm was used to present information on 
the environmental significance for optimizing waste collection routes. 
The study assessed the use of roll-on/roll-off containers while also 
considering schedules and lunch breaks.  Through the utilization of an 
adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm, alongside a clustering method, 
a residential waste collection was analysed, taking into consideration 
actual pick up points and employee lunch breaks.  Using this information, 
time windows and starting conditions were adapted alongside the routes to 
reduce the total distance by as much as forty-five 
percent~\cite{shahrokni2014big}.

\section{Conclusion}
Waste management has been a growing concern and will continue to be an 
important area for optimization as both consumer waste and population 
increase. As institutions, governments, and individuals look to assess 
and optimize resources, minimize cost and create less of an environmental 
impact of waste management, Big Data has the potential to continue to help 
provide the information needed for future advancement.

There are various tools being used to optimize the different waste 
management practices, and there is space to develop additional tools 
to continue to the information available to decision makers.

One of the main reasons to use Big data in Municipal Waste Management is 
to provide local governments with tools that would facilitate the 
implementation of systems to more efficiently manage how much, where and 
the growth rate of the material that the community dispossess. Optimizing 
the waste management systems can help minimize the environmental impact of 
the community's actions, reduce pollution, increase rates of recycled 
materials, optimize routes to reduce time and expenses, among others.
By using Big data, local governments can also track the number and quantity 
or weight of disposals at different locations; this information can be 
mapped to reveal the locations of the most significant waste generators. 
This information will help entities develop specific strategies to reduce 
waste and help implement permanent solutions for better environments. 

Waste Management is not only government issue. Citizens should take the 
initiative and educate others on how to recycle and reduce waste. With the 
help of the collected data, governments can notify the different entities
 (individuals, communities, companies and other organizations) a equip them 
through education and awareness, and also share valuable information about 
the importance of waste management through different media, such as mobile 
phones, email, among others.

Local governments have just started to adopt Big Data technologies for 
solving problems involved in MSW, but there is plenty of room for growth 
and further use and development.  By using Big Data Analytic, large amounts 
of data sets pertaining to specific communities waste, routes, and disposal 
can be used to identify trends and patterns that could highlight opportunities 
for improvement. Big Data can play a significant role in managing cities more 
efficiently, benefiting not only those managing the systems, but the 
communities in which they are implemented as well.
