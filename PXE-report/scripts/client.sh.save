The client Raspberry Pi will need a root file system to boot off, so before you do anything else on the server, make a full copy of its file system and put it in a directory called /nfs/client1The client Raspberry Pi will need a root file system to boot off, so before you do anything else on the server, make a full copy of its file system and put it in a directory called /nfs/client1:

sudo mkdir -p /nfs/client1
sudo apt install rsync
sudo rsync -xa --progress --exclude /nfs / /nfs/client1

Regenerate SSH host keys on the client filesystem by chrooting into it:

cd /nfs/client1
sudo mount --bind /dev dev
sudo mount --bind /sys sys
sudo mount --bind /proc proc
sudo chroot .
rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
exit
sudo umount dev sys proc

Find the settings of your local network. You need to find the address of your router (or gateway), which can be done with:

ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3}'

Then run:

ip -4 addr show dev eth0 | grep inet

which should give an output like:

inet 10.42.0.211/24 brd 10.42.0.255 scope global eth0
